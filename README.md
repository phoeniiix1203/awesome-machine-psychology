## TODO

### Urgent
- [] Determine a citation criteria for papers
- [] Add ACL 2023 papers.
- [] Add AAAI 2023 papers.
- [] Add a "author" section for papers.
- [] Add a "code" section (between "PDF" and "Published in") for papers whose authors release the code.

### Not Urgent
- [] Sort papers by topic.
- [] Add a "Video" section for good vids on machine psychology
- [] Add a "Blogs" section for good blogs about machine psychology
