# Awesome Machine Psychology

[![Awesome](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/sindresorhus/awesome@d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)

A curated collection of exceptional papers, datasets, and models related to machine psychology, which is the study of artificial intelligence (AI) systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), through experimental and theoretical approaches traditionally used in human psychology.

This project was developed at [OMNILab](https://github.com/OMNILab), Shanghai Jiao Tong University, by [Xiangtiange Li](https://github.com/tranquiltina), [Qiyuan Gu](https://github.com/phoeniiix1203), and [Xingyue Zhang](https://github.com/Adazhangdada), under the guidance of Professor Yaohui Jin and Dr. Binglei Zhao. OMNILab is now part of the [BaiYuLan Open AI community](https://github.com/Bai-Yu-Lan).

## TODO

### Urgent
- [ ] Determine a citation criteria for papers.
- [ ] Add ACL 2023 papers.
- [ ] Add AAAI 2023 papers.
- [ ] Add a "author" section for papers.
- [ ] Add a "code" section (between "PDF" and "Published in") for papers whose authors release the code. Then update the relevant "datasets" and "models" section.

### Not Urgent
- [ ] Sort papers by topic.
- [ ] Add a "Video" section for good vids on machine psychology
- [ ] Add a "Blogs" section for good blogs about machine psychology

## Templates

### Papers

Citation criteria

- < 6 months : 5 citations or by discussion
- 2024 : 10 citations
- 2023 : 25 citations
- 2022 : 50 citations

(I don't think papers before 2022 should be included, as they are kind of outdated for LLMs today)

If the paper only has an arXiv preprint link, skip the "published in" section

```markdown
****

- Published in:
